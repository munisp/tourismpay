## Known Limitations

1. **ERP Retry Worker**: The `erp_sync_log` table queries fail with ECONNREFUSED in the sandbox environment because the ERP integration targets a remote ERPNext instance not available in the sandbox. This is expected behaviour in development and does not affect any other functionality.

2. **Fluvio Streaming**: Fluvio is configured but disabled by default in local development (`FLUVIO_ENABLED=false`). Events are logged to console as fallback.

3. **PostgreSQL**: The local PostgreSQL instance must be started manually in the sandbox (`sudo pg_ctlcluster 14 main start`). In production, the database is provided by the platform.

4. **SMTP**: Email delivery requires SMTP credentials (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`) to be configured via secrets management.

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `POSTGRES_URL` to production database connection string
- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` to a cryptographically random 64-byte secret
- [ ] Configure SMTP credentials for email delivery
- [ ] Replace self-signed TLS certificates in `nginx.conf` with CA-signed certificates
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Run `pnpm db:push` against production database to apply all migrations
- [ ] Configure Fluvio cluster endpoint (`FLUVIO_BROKER_URL`)
- [ ] Configure ERPNext endpoint (`ERP_BASE_URL`, `ERP_API_KEY`, `ERP_API_SECRET`)
- [ ] Set up CBN/NFIU reporting webhook endpoints
- [ ] Enable mTLS for inter-service communication (`MTLS_ENABLED=true`)
- [ ] Configure geofence zones for each terminal region
- [ ] Seed initial admin agent account
- [ ] Run smoke tests against production endpoints
