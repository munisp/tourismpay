### Added

**Infrastructure**

- TigerBeetle 3-node cluster (`infra/tigerbeetle/docker-compose.cluster.yml`, `init-cluster.sh`) replacing single-node setup for fault tolerance
- Fluvio SmartModule Rust workspace with three production-ready modules: `transaction-filter`, `fraud-enricher`, `mdm-heartbeat-parser` (full source + unit tests)
- MinIO bucket lifecycle policies: screenshots (30-day expiry), firmware (365-day), lakehouse Bronze→Silver→Gold tiering
- APISix bootstrap script seeding all 20+ routes via Admin API with JWT auth plugin
- Comprehensive `.env.production` with all 60+ environment variables set to production-ready defaults (no CHANGE_ME placeholders)
- One-command bootstrap script `scripts/bootstrap-production.sh` orchestrating full cluster startup

**MDM & OTA**

- OTA service: replaced placeholder download URL with real S3/MinIO presigned URL generation (15-minute expiry, AWS SDK v2)
- Kotlin `MdmCommandExecutor` supporting 11 command types (LOCK_SCREEN, REBOOT, CLEAR_APP_DATA, SET_PASSCODE_POLICY, WIPE_DEVICE, ENABLE/DISABLE_WIFI, SCREENSHOT, OTA_UPDATE, SET_KIOSK_MODE, PING)
- Kotlin `DeviceTelemetryCollector` collecting battery, network, storage, RAM, and security telemetry
- Kotlin `MdmBootReceiver` auto-scheduling HeartbeatWorker after device reboot
- Go MDM compliance engine HTTP handler layer with full test suite (7 tests)

**CBN Compliance**

- APScheduler cron scheduler wired into CBN reporting engine (`scheduler.py`) with daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly jobs
- Python test suite for CBN compliance rules (16 tests, 2 skipped pending APScheduler install)

**Monitoring**

- Prometheus MDM alert rules (`monitoring/prometheus/alerts/mdm.rules.yml`): 8 alert rules covering heartbeat queue depth, device offline, compliance violations, OTA failures
- Prometheus CBN alert rules (`monitoring/prometheus/alerts/cbn.rules.yml`): 7 alert rules covering report submission, daily limit breaches, KYC compliance rate
- Grafana MDM Fleet dashboard JSON (`monitoring/grafana/dashboards/mdm-fleet.json`)
- Grafana CBN Compliance dashboard JSON (`monitoring/grafana/dashboards/cbn-compliance.json`)

**CI/CD**

- Playwright E2E tests split into 3 parallel shards (reduces wall-clock time from ~8 min to ~3 min)
- Playwright shard report merge job (`playwright-merge-reports`)
- Go microservice test job (`go-tests`) covering MDM compliance engine, geofence service, OTA service
- Python microservice test job (`python-tests`) covering CBN reporting engine, KYC service, fraud engine
- Playwright E2E specs 06 (MDM device management) and 07 (CBN compliance reporting)
- k6 OTA load test (`k6/mdm-ota-update.js`) simulating 200 devices polling for firmware updates

**Documentation**

- `RUNBOOK.md` fully updated to Phase 161 covering all 24 services, TigerBeetle cluster, MDM commands, CBN compliance tiers
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS_FINAL.md` comprehensive architecture reference, deployment checklist, CBN compliance matrix
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) documenting all phases
