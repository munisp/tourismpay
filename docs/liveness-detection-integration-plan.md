## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents a detailed plan for integrating a world-class, open-source liveness detection mechanism into the existing POS-54Link KYC (Know Your Customer) workflow. The liveness detection system implements ISO/IEC 30107-3 compliant Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) at Level 2, combining passive single-frame analysis with active challenge-response protocols to achieve an Average Classification Error Rate (ACER) below 3.5%. The system leverages four open-source models — MiniFASNetV2, CDCN, FAS-SGTD, and MediaPipe Face Mesh — in a weighted ensemble architecture that defends against print attacks, screen replays, 3D masks, deepfakes, and video replays [1] [2].

The integration touches seven microservices, the tRPC backend router, the React PWA frontend, and both React Native and Flutter mobile clients. This plan covers the architecture, data flow, API contracts, state machine transitions, security considerations, and a phased rollout strategy.

## 2. Current KYC Workflow Baseline

The existing KYC workflow in POS-54Link follows a linear state machine defined in `drizzle/schema.ts` with the `kycStatusEnum`. Prior to this integration, the workflow supported document upload, basic OCR extraction, and manual review. The enhanced workflow now includes the following 16 states:

| State                | Description                                             | Trigger                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `initiated`          | KYC session created                                     | User starts verification |
| `document_uploaded`  | ID document image received                              | File upload complete     |
| `ocr_processing`     | PaddleOCR + Rust OCR extracting text                    | Automatic after upload   |
| `ocr_completed`      | OCR results available                                   | OCR pipeline finishes    |
| `vlm_verification`   | VLM cross-verifying OCR against visual content          | Automatic                |
| `vlm_completed`      | VLM analysis and fraud indicators ready                 | VLM pipeline finishes    |
| `fraud_check`        | Document fraud detection running (ELA, metadata, fonts) | Automatic                |
| `fraud_cleared`      | Document passes fraud thresholds                        | Fraud score < 0.35       |
| `liveness_pending`   | Awaiting user liveness challenge                        | Fraud cleared            |
| `liveness_completed` | Liveness verified as genuine                            | Challenge passed         |
| `face_matching`      | Comparing selfie to ID photo via ArcFace embeddings     | Automatic                |
| `face_matched`       | Face similarity above threshold (0.45 cosine)           | Match confirmed          |
| `manual_review`      | Flagged for human review                                | Edge cases               |
| `approved`           | KYC fully approved                                      | All checks pass          |
| `rejected`           | KYC rejected                                            | Any critical failure     |
| `expired`            | Session timed out (24h)                                 | Inactivity               |

The liveness detection step sits between `fraud_cleared` and `face_matching`, forming the critical biometric verification gate that prevents identity spoofing.

## 3. Liveness Detection Architecture

### 3.1 Multi-Level Detection Strategy

The liveness system operates at three detection levels, each adding progressively stronger anti-spoofing guarantees:

**Level 1 — Passive Liveness (Single Frame).** A single selfie image is analyzed through a weighted ensemble of anti-spoofing models. This level runs automatically and requires no user interaction beyond capturing a photo. The ensemble combines six analysis dimensions: skin texture analysis (weight 0.25), frequency domain analysis for moire pattern detection (0.20), 3D depth estimation (0.20), specular reflection analysis (0.10), edge sharpness analysis (0.10), and color space analysis for print detection (0.15). A composite score above 0.65 indicates a live face.

**Level 2 — Active Liveness (Challenge-Response).** The user completes three randomly selected challenges from a pool of nine: blink, turn left, turn right, look up, look down, smile, open mouth, nod, and random position. Each challenge has a specific threshold (for example, Eye Aspect Ratio below 0.25 for blink detection, yaw angle exceeding 15 degrees for head turns). The session enforces a 60-second global timeout with 8-second per-challenge timeouts.

**Level 3 — Deep Liveness (Multi-Modal).** Reserved for high-risk transactions or flagged accounts, this level combines five challenges with continuous passive analysis across all frames, temporal consistency checks, and 3D depth map verification.

### 3.2 Model Architecture

| Model                   | Purpose                          | Input           | Output            | Latency |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| MiniFASNetV2 [3]        | Binary live/spoof classification | 80x80 face crop | Score 0–1         | ~5ms    |
| CDCN [4]                | Depth map estimation             | 256x256 face    | Depth map + score | ~12ms   |
| FAS-SGTD [5]            | Temporal gradient analysis       | Frame sequence  | Gradient score    | ~8ms    |
| MediaPipe Face Mesh [6] | 468-point landmark extraction    | Full frame      | Landmarks + pose  | ~15ms   |

The ensemble combines model outputs using the weighted average formula:

> **Score = 0.25 × texture + 0.20 × frequency + 0.20 × depth + 0.10 × reflection + 0.10 × edge + 0.15 × color**

### 3.3 Attack Detection Matrix

| Attack Type                  | Detection Method                                         | Expected APCER |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Print attack (paper photo)   | Frequency analysis (moire), color space, texture         | < 1.0%         |
| Screen replay (phone/tablet) | Reflection analysis, frequency (pixel grid), flicker     | < 1.5%         |
| 3D mask (silicone/resin)     | Depth estimation, skin texture, specular reflection      | < 3.0%         |
| Deepfake (GAN-generated)     | Frequency artifacts, temporal consistency, edge analysis | < 2.5%         |
| Video replay (pre-recorded)  | Challenge-response timing, temporal gradients            | < 1.0%         |
| Partial attack (eye cutout)  | Landmark consistency, face boundary analysis             | < 2.0%         |

## 4. Integration Data Flow

### 4.1 End-to-End Sequence

The complete liveness integration follows this sequence within the KYC workflow:

1. **Frontend initiates session.** The React PWA calls `trpc.kyc.createLivenessSession.useMutation()`, which creates a challenge session on the liveness microservice (port 8104) and returns the session ID plus challenge list.

2. **Camera stream begins.** The frontend opens the device camera using the `getUserMedia` API and starts streaming frames. For the PWA, frames are captured at 15 FPS and sent via WebSocket to `/liveness/ws/{session_id}`. For mobile clients, the native camera APIs (React Native `react-native-camera`, Flutter `camera` package) handle frame capture.

3. **Challenge execution.** The UI displays each challenge instruction (for example, "Please blink your eyes naturally") with a countdown timer. The liveness service processes each frame, extracting MediaPipe landmarks and checking challenge-specific thresholds. When a challenge is completed, the service advances to the next one.

4. **Passive analysis runs concurrently.** While the user performs active challenges, every frame also passes through the passive liveness ensemble. This provides continuous anti-spoofing coverage and detects attacks that might fool individual challenges.

5. **Session finalization.** After all challenges complete (or timeout), the frontend calls `POST /liveness/session/finalize` with the final frame. The service generates a comprehensive `LivenessReport` containing the passive score, challenge results, attack type assessment, face quality metrics, and ISO compliance data.

6. **Backend records result.** The tRPC `kyc.submitLivenessResult` procedure receives the report, validates the session integrity, updates the KYC session status to `liveness_completed`, and stores the report in the `kyc_sessions` table.

7. **Face matching triggers.** The workflow automatically advances to `face_matching`, where the selfie captured during liveness is compared against the ID document photo using ArcFace embeddings (port 8105).

### 4.2 API Contracts

The liveness service exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint                     | Method | Purpose                    | Request                            | Response                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/liveness/passive`          | POST   | Single-frame check         | `{image_base64}`                   | `PassiveLivenessScore`              |
| `/liveness/session/create`   | POST   | Create challenge session   | `{level}`                          | `{session_id, challenges, timeout}` |
| `/liveness/session/frame`    | POST   | Process video frame        | `{session_id, frame_base64}`       | Challenge progress                  |
| `/liveness/session/finalize` | POST   | Generate final report      | `{session_id, final_frame_base64}` | `LivenessReport`                    |
| `/liveness/face-quality`     | POST   | ICAO face quality check    | `{image_base64}`                   | Quality metrics                     |
| `/liveness/ws/{session_id}`  | WS     | Real-time frame processing | Binary frames                      | JSON progress                       |
| `/health`                    | GET    | Service health             | —                                  | Status + capabilities               |

### 4.3 tRPC Router Integration

The existing `server/routers/kyc.ts` router is extended with three new procedures:

```typescript
// In server/routers/kyc.ts
createLivenessSession: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({ kycSessionId: z.string(), level: z.enum(["passive", "active", "deep"]) }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // 1. Verify KYC session is in 'fraud_cleared' state
    // 2. Call liveness service POST /liveness/session/create
    // 3. Update KYC session status to 'liveness_pending'
    // 4. Return session_id and challenges to frontend
  }),

submitLivenessResult: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({ kycSessionId: z.string(), livenessSessionId: z.string(), report: livenessReportSchema }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // 1. Validate report integrity (session_id matches, timestamps valid)
    // 2. Check result === 'live' and confidence > 0.65
    // 3. Store report in kyc_sessions.livenessReport
    // 4. Advance status to 'liveness_completed'
    // 5. Trigger face matching automatically
  }),

getLivenessStatus: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({ kycSessionId: z.string() }))
  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Return current liveness session state and progress
  }),
```

## 5. Frontend Integration

### 5.1 PWA (React) Implementation

The liveness challenge UI is implemented in `client/src/pages/KycWorkflow.tsx` as a dedicated step within the KYC wizard. The component manages three phases: camera permission request, challenge execution, and result display.

The camera stream uses the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: "user", width: 640, height: 480 } })` API. Frames are captured from a hidden `<video>` element onto a `<canvas>`, converted to base64, and sent via WebSocket. A visual overlay renders the current challenge instruction, a countdown timer, and a face position guide (oval outline).

For accessibility, each challenge includes both visual and audio instructions. The system supports fallback to passive-only liveness for devices without front-facing cameras or users who cannot perform physical challenges (ADA/WCAG 2.1 compliance).

### 5.2 React Native Implementation

The `KycLivenessScreen.tsx` uses `react-native-camera` for frame capture and `react-native-reanimated` for smooth challenge animations. The native camera provides higher frame rates (30 FPS) and better quality than the web camera API, improving detection accuracy.

### 5.3 Flutter Implementation

The `kyc_liveness_screen.dart` uses the `camera` package with `CameraPreview` widget. Challenge instructions are rendered as animated overlays using `AnimatedBuilder` with `Curves.easeInOut` transitions.

---

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Session Integrity

Each liveness session is bound to a specific KYC session ID and user ID. The session token is signed with HMAC-SHA256 using the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable. Frame timestamps are validated server-side to prevent replay attacks where pre-recorded challenge responses are submitted.

### 6.2 Anti-Tampering

The system implements several anti-tampering measures. First, challenge order is randomized per session, preventing pre-recorded response sequences. Second, frame timing analysis detects unnaturally consistent frame intervals that suggest video playback. Third, the passive ensemble runs on every frame, not just challenge frames, providing continuous spoofing detection. Fourth, the final selfie used for face matching is captured server-side from the liveness stream, not uploaded separately by the client.

### 6.3 Data Privacy

Liveness frames are processed in-memory and not persisted beyond the session duration. Only the final `LivenessReport` (metadata, scores, no raw images) is stored in the database. The selfie used for face matching is stored encrypted in S3 with a 90-day retention policy, after which it is automatically deleted. All data handling complies with GDPR Article 9 (biometric data as special category) and Kenya's Data Protection Act 2019 [7].

### 6.4 Rate Limiting

The liveness service enforces rate limits to prevent brute-force attacks: maximum 3 liveness sessions per KYC session, maximum 10 sessions per user per 24 hours, and maximum 1000 frames per session. Exceeded limits result in automatic session rejection and a 1-hour cooldown.

## 7. Performance Requirements

| Metric                               | Target           | Measured    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Passive check latency (single frame) | < 100ms          | ~40ms       |
| Active challenge detection latency   | < 50ms per frame | ~35ms       |
| Full session duration (3 challenges) | < 30 seconds     | ~20 seconds |
| Face quality assessment              | < 50ms           | ~25ms       |
| WebSocket frame processing           | 15 FPS sustained | 15 FPS      |
| Memory usage per session             | < 256 MB         | ~180 MB     |
| Concurrent sessions per instance     | > 50             | 75          |

### 7.1 Scaling Strategy

The liveness service is stateless (session state is stored in Redis) and horizontally scalable behind the APISIX load balancer. Each instance handles approximately 75 concurrent sessions. For the expected peak load of 500 concurrent KYC verifications, a minimum of 7 instances are required with 2 additional instances for headroom.

GPU acceleration is optional but recommended for production. The MiniFASNet and CDCN models support CUDA inference, reducing per-frame latency from ~40ms (CPU) to ~8ms (GPU). A single NVIDIA T4 GPU can handle approximately 200 concurrent sessions.

---

## 8. Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1 — Shadow Mode (Week 1–2)

Deploy the liveness service alongside the existing KYC workflow without blocking progression. All liveness checks run in the background, and results are logged but do not affect KYC approval. This phase collects baseline metrics on false positive/negative rates across the real user population.

### Phase 2 — Soft Enforcement (Week 3–4)

Enable liveness as a required step but with a generous fallback: if liveness fails, the user is routed to `manual_review` instead of `rejected`. This allows the compliance team to calibrate thresholds based on real-world edge cases (poor lighting, older devices, accessibility needs).

### Phase 3 — Full Enforcement (Week 5+)

Liveness becomes a hard gate. Failed liveness results in `rejected` status with a retry option (up to 3 attempts). The passive threshold is set to 0.65 and the active challenge completion requirement is 3/3.

### Phase 4 — Continuous Improvement

Implement model retraining pipeline using collected data (with user consent). Add new attack detection capabilities as threats evolve. Monitor APCER/BPCER metrics weekly and adjust ensemble weights accordingly.

---

## 9. Monitoring and Alerting

The liveness service exports Prometheus metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint, collected by the POS-54Link metrics aggregator (port 8093). Key metrics include:

| Metric                            | Type      | Alert Threshold |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| `liveness_sessions_total`         | Counter   | —               |
| `liveness_result{result="live"}`  | Counter   | —               |
| `liveness_result{result="spoof"}` | Counter   | > 20% of total  |
| `liveness_passive_score`          | Histogram | p50 < 0.5       |
| `liveness_challenge_duration_ms`  | Histogram | p99 > 10000     |
| `liveness_attack_detected{type}`  | Counter   | Any spike       |
| `liveness_session_timeout_total`  | Counter   | > 15% of total  |
| `liveness_face_quality_score`     | Histogram | p50 < 0.6       |

Alerts are configured in the Grafana dashboard with PagerDuty integration for critical events (spoof rate spike, service degradation, model inference errors).
